As you are aware, we have recently decided to cut the display output of every company computer by 72.6776%, which Finance predicts will boost our profit by a significant 5%.\n\nPlease be reminded that despite this change in work environment, we expect every employee to complete their work at the same rate as prior to the change. Failure to do so will result in a performance review and potential termination of your employment.\n\nStrive for Innovation.\n\nSigned,\nMGMT-AUTOMATED-MESSAGE";
